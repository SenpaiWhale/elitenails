Website for a local business.  Live version here: http://www.elitenailsaledo.com

This application is written in Node.JS with some light jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap for the front-end.  I used reCAPTCHA to validate form inputs and [NodeMailer JS](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) as an appointment booking helper.

##Roadmap

* Phone and email verification
* Move appointment booking to implement MongoDB
* Enable user confirmation of bookings

##How to Run the App

* Clone the project to your Projects directory.
* Make changes to your files.
* Start the app by typing `npm start`
* Start Chrome, type in "http://localhost:3000/"
